<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Your privacy is important to us. We respect your privacy and comply with applicable laws and regulations regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app, Namecare.</p>
<p>When you use Namecare, you accept and understand that we collect, process, use and store your information as described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you must not use Namecare.</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy is effective as of 21 August 2023.</p>
<p>Last updated: 21 August 2023.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>
<p>Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.</p>
<p>“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using Namecare. </p>
<p>“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing Namecare and its associated services.</p>

<h3>Personal Information</h3>
<p>We may ask for personal information. For example, when you register an account you will be asked to provide your email and a password. You may also provide us with your personal information when you contact us or information you choose to provide to allow us with to assist you.
</p>

<h3>Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide our services to you. We try to collect very limited personal data via Namecare, in most cases necessary for the app to function.</p>

<h3>Collection and Use of Information</h3>
<div>
    <p>We may collect personal information from you when you do any of the following:</p>
    - Register for an account<br>
    - Indicate domain names<br>
    - Contact us via email, social media, or on any similar technologies<br>
    - When you mention us on social media.<br>

    <p>We may collect, hold, use, and disclose information for the following purposes, and personal information will not be further processed in a manner that is incompatible with these purposes:</p>
    - to provide you with Namecare core features and services.<br>
    - to enable you to access and use Namecare.<br>

</div>

<h3>Security of Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.</p>
<p>Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.</p>
<p>You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts are secure and confidential.</p>

<h3>How Long We Keep Your Personal Information</h3>
<p>We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.</p>
<p>However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation.</p>

<h2>Disclosure of Personal Information to Third Parties</h2>
<div>
    <p>We may disclose personal information to:</p>
    - third-party service providers for the purpose of enabling them to provide their services, including (without limitation) IT service providers, data storage, hosting and server providers, maintenance or problem-solving providers, professional advisors, and payment systems operators.<br>
    - our employees, contractors, and/or related entities.<br>
    - courts, tribunals, regulatory authorities, and law enforcement officers, as required by law, in connection with any actual or prospective legal proceedings, or in order to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights.<br>
</div>

<h2>International Transfers of Personal Information</h2>
<p>The personal information we collect is stored where we or our third-party providers maintain facilities.</p>
<p>The countries to which we store, process, or transfer your personal information may not have the same data protection laws as the country in which you initially provided the information. If we transfer your personal information to third parties in other countries: (i) we will perform those transfers in accordance with the requirements of applicable law; and (ii) we will protect the transferred personal information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. </p>

<h2>Your Rights and Controlling Your Personal Information</h2>

<h2>Business Transfers</h2>

You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any parties who acquire us may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, continue to use your personal information according to this policy, which they will be required to assume as it is the basis for any ownership or use rights we have over such information.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>At our discretion, we may change our Privacy Policy to reflect updates to our business processes, current acceptable practices, or legislative or regulatory changes. If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post the changes here.</p>
