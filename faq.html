        - 1 month before<br>
        - 2 weeks before<br>

    <div class="faq">
    <div class="question">Pro version: how does the autofill feature work?</div>
    <div class="answer">
        The autofill feature in Namecare uses "whois" to fill expiration date and other fields. This makes adding domains to your list faster and more accurate, saving you time and reducing the likelihood of errors.
    </div>

    <div class="question">Pro version: what are the payment options?</div>

        At the moment, only monthly billing is available. If you upgrade to the pro version, payment will be charged to your iTunes account, and your account will be charged for renewal within 24 hours prior to the end of the current period. You can turn off auto-renew in your Apple ID Account Settings at any time after purchase.
